    <h1>PS2</h1>

    <p>
      The first game I played was Crash Twinsanity on the Playstation 2. However, by the end, I had my mom help me finish the game. I think my little brother was there with us.
      While the first game completion was not my own, I was still enthusiastic about playing games on the PS2. After Twinsanity, I brought and played every Crash game on the PS2, while having no idea the original series existed and it was on the PS1.
      Buying PS2 games in my country, Indonesia, is so easy. They cost less than a dollar!

    <h1>PS1</h1>
    <p>
      One day, my PS2 hype died down and I stopped playing console games altogether. I don&rsquo; remember what interest I had at the time, but I think I was more interested in playing games on my phone. However, after a while, I wanted to play games again and decided to buy a PS1 to play the classics. I played Spyro the Dragon and Crash Bandicoot, which I found out existed after playing every ps2 Crash game.
