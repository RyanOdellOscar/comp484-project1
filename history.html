    <h1>A generation by generation overview of consoles</h1>
    <h2>First Generation (1950s - 1970s)</h2>
    <p>
      The history of video games can be divided into several generations, each marked by significant technological advancements and changes in the gaming industry. The first generation of video games began in the 1950s and lasted until the early 1970s. During this time, the first electronic games were created, such as Tennis for Two and Spacewar!. These games were simple and often played on large mainframe computers.
    </p>
    <h2>Second Generation (1970s - 1980s)</h2>
    <p>
      Arcade games became popular in the 1970s, with titles like Pong and Space Invaders drawing large crowds to arcades. The second generation also saw the introduction of home consoles, with the release of the Magnavox Odyssey in 1972. However, it was the release of the Atari 2600 in 1977 that truly revolutionized the gaming industry. The Atari 2600 allowed players to play a variety of games using interchangeable cartridges, which led to a surge in popularity for home gaming.
      The 1980s was a significant decade for the video game industry. It saw the rise of home consoles, with the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1985. The NES was a huge success and helped to revitalize the video game industry after the crash of 1983. It introduced iconic games like Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid, which are still beloved by gamers today.
    </p>
    <h2>Third Generation (1990s)</h2>
    <p>
      The 1990s saw the rise of 3D graphics and online gaming. The release of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) in 1990 and the Sega Genesis in 1989 marked the beginning of the third generation of video games. These consoles featured improved graphics and sound capabilities, which allowed for more immersive gaming experiences. The 1990s also saw the introduction of online gaming, with games like Doom and Quake allowing players to connect and play against each other over the internet.
      The release of the Sony PlayStation in 1994 and the Nintendo 64 in 1996 further pushed the boundaries of gaming technology. The PlayStation introduced CD-ROM technology, which allowed for larger and more complex games, while the Nintendo 64 featured advanced 3D graphics capabilities. The third generation also saw the rise of handheld gaming with the release of the Game Boy Advance in 1998.
    </p>
    <h2>Fourth Generation (2000s - present)</h2>
    <p>
      The 2000s brought about the popularity of mobile gaming, with the release of smartphones and tablets. The introduction of the iPhone in 2007 and the App Store in 2008 made it easier for developers to create and distribute mobile games. Mobile gaming has since become a major part of the gaming industry, with millions of players worldwide.
      The fourth generation also saw the rise of online multiplayer gaming, with games like World of Warcraft and Call of Duty allowing players to connect and play together online. The release of the Xbox 360 in 2005, the PlayStation 3 in 2006, and the Nintendo Wii in 2006 marked the beginning of this generation. These consoles featured improved graphics and online capabilities, which allowed for more immersive gaming experiences.
      Today, video games continue to evolve with advancements in technology, offering players new and exciting experiences. Virtual reality (VR) gaming has become increasingly popular, with devices like the Oculus Rift and PlayStation VR providing immersive gaming experiences. The future of video games looks promising, with new technologies and innovations on the horizon.
