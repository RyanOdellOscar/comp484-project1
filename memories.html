    <h1>PS2</h1>

    <p>
      The first game I played was Crash Twinsanity on the Playstation 2. However, by the end, I had my mom help me finish the game. I think my little brother was there with us.
      While the first game completion was not my own, I was still enthusiastic about playing games on the PS2. After Twinsanity, I brought and played every Crash game on the PS2, while having no idea the original series existed and it was on the PS1.
      Buying PS2 games in my country, Indonesia, is so easy. They cost less than a dollar!

    <h1>PS1</h1>
    <p>
      One day, my PS2 hype died down and I stopped playing console games altogether. I don&rsquo; remember what interest I had at the time, but I think I was more interested in watching TV.
      I remember watching Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network on the couch. However, after a while, I wanted to play games again and decided to buy a PS1 to play the classics like the original Crash trilogy and Spyro the Dragon.
      Later, I found the old PS2 in the broom closet and decided to boot it back up. We had the Ps1 on the PS2 and switched the RGB cables whenever we wanted to. When I found out about other PS2 classics like the Ratchet and Clank series and Sly Cooper, I was so excited to play them.
      The PS2 eventually stopped working and I had to give it back to my aunt. Sad, but there a lot of good memories with the PS2.

    <h1>Nintendo 3DS</h1>
    <p>
      During my middle schoold and going into highchool years, Sometimes my cousin would visit his parents next door to us and stayed there when he was on break.
      Whenever he came, me and my brother would beg our parents to let us sleep over at his place since we knew he brought some cool gaming stuff with him. Some of those things included a modded 3DS and 2DS.
      We played on his stuff for hours during the sleepovers, and I was really interested in the games he had. On the 3DS, I played Pokemon Red but could not get past Misty and never saw it again.
      On the 2DS I played Ocarina of Time 3D and Majora's Mask 3D. Eventually, my cousin decided to just give me the 2DS as a birthday present, and I was so happy to have it. I played Pokemon Y and tried to continue with Pokemon Sun, but I just couldn&rsquo;t get into it.
      Unfortunately, the 2DS stopped working one day. Luckily, I brought it to the states and found someone to look at it. As of writing this, the 2DS is still not working, but I hope it can be fixed soon.

    <h1>Switch</h1>
    <p>
      I got my Switch for my birthday, and I was so excited to play it. I had been wanting a Switch for a while because I saw the Switch my cousin owned and I finally got one. I played Super Mario Odyssey as a launch title and then borrowed Pokemon Sword and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild from my cousin.
      I continued to play the Switch and got more games for it, such as Super Smash Bros. Ultimate all the way to my highschool graduation. I played a lot of games on the Switch, and it was my main gaming console for the longest time.
      When the time came for me to move to the US for college, I had to bring my Switch with me. I was so happy to have it with me, and I played it a lot to this day.

    <h1>PS4</h1>
    <p>
      I was not the only one that was surprised with a new gaming console. My brother also got a PS4 for his birthday. Of course, I also wanted to use it. It sat in the living room of our house on the second floor and remains there to this day.
      It basically replaced any function the TV had previously, as we used it to watch movies and TV shows on Netflix and YouTube. We also played games on it, such as the Spyro Reignited Trilogy. However, now that I moved to the US, I don&rsquo;t have access to the PS4 anymore.
      Luckily, I can still play it when I go home to visit my family in the summer and of course, I made sure to get a few PS4 games before I do.
