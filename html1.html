        The history of video games dates back to the 1950s when the first electronic games were created. In the 1970s, arcade games became popular, and in the 1980s, home consoles like the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) were introduced. The 1990s saw the rise of 3D graphics and online gaming, while the 2000s brought about the popularity of mobile gaming.

    <h2>My game history</h2>
    <p>
      To keep the focus personal, I will retell my own history of games rather than focus on the actual history. The first game I played was Crash Twinsanity on the Playstation 2. To be specific, I watched my older cousin play the game, as he and his brother were the only ones in my family with a gaming console at the time. I remember being fascinated by the colorful graphics and the fun gameplay.
      I was in elementary school at the time and looked forward to visiting my cousin's house to play the game. One day, my cousin gave me his ps2 so I could play the game at home. I remember needing my mom to help play to the end of Crash Twinsanity, probably because I was so bad.
      From there, I played various games on the PS2, including the Ratchet and Clank series, which I really enjoyed. Eventually, we decided to buy the PS1 so I could experience the classics like Spyro the Dragon and Crash Bandicoot, which I found out existed after playing every ps2 Crash game.
      An unforgettable moment was during my birthday when I received a Nintendo Switch as a gift. I was thrilled to have my own after seeing Super Mario Odyssey on my cousin's and spent hours playing games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild which I borrowed from my cousin. The Switch has become my go-to gaming console, and I have enjoyed playing a variety of games on it, Odyssey to Pokemon. Overall, my gaming history has been filled with fun and memorable experiences that have shaped my love for video games.

      To end things off, let me explain my gaming plans for the future. After finishing gen 8 and 9 Pokemon, including Scarlet/Violet I decided to try to see if I can somehow play previous generations. I have been able to play gen 7 and 6, but I have not been able to play gen 5 or earlier.
      I am currently trying to find a way to play Pokemon Emerald in gen 3, as I have heard good things about it. I am also hoping my modded 3DS comes back from repairs and can play gen 4-7 games. Otherwise, I might have to buy a used 3DS just to play those games or spend hundreds of dollars on the old cartridges.
      Then, I would have to spend more money on authentic hardware. I would even consider buying something from Temu. In conclusion, if anyone reading this knows how to play gen 3-5 Pokemon games for cheap, please let me know. I would really appreciate it.
